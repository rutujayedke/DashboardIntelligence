Build an AI-Powered KPI Audit Tool
Project Overview
Create an AI-powered KPI audit tool that analyzes organizational metrics and identifies redundant, misleading, or zero-impact metrics ("vanity metrics") while recommending the most valuable metrics for business outcomes.

Background Context
Many organizations track numerous KPIs in fancy dashboards, but only a small percentage actually drive decision-making and business outcomes. This leads to:

Information overload for executives
Teams optimizing for metrics that don't matter
Resources wasted on tracking, reporting, and discussing meaningless data
Poor decision-making due to focus on the wrong signals
Real-world examples:

Sales teams optimizing for "calls made per day" leading to representatives making meaningless calls just to hit targets
Design teams achieving 100% "feedback resolution rate" by auto-responding with "thanks!" to all feedback
Dashboards tracking 27+ KPIs when only 2-3 actually matter for outcomes
Dataset Description
The provided CSV file contains information about 60 metrics across different departments with the following columns:

Department: The department responsible for the metric
Metric_Name: Name of the KPI
Visible_in_Dashboard: Whether the metric is displayed in dashboards
Used_in_Decision_Making: Whether the metric is actually used for decisions
Executive_Requested: Whether an executive specifically requested this metric
Last_Reviewed: When the metric was last reviewed
Metric_Last_Used_For_Decision: Last time the metric influenced a decision
Interpretation_Notes: Additional context about how the metric is used
Project Requirements
Core Functionality:
Metric Analysis Engine
Parse and analyze the CSV data
Apply classification algorithms to identify metrics that are:
Visible but not used in decision-making
Requested by executives but not actionable
Not reviewed recently
Have low or no impact on business outcomes
Recommendation System
Identify the top 3 most valuable metrics for each department
Provide justification for why these metrics matter
Suggest metrics that could be removed from dashboards
Visualization Dashboard
Create an interactive dashboard showing:
Vanity metric distribution by department
Metrics usage analysis
Impact assessment of current metrics
Recommended metrics with supporting evidence
Technical Requirements:
Use Python for data analysis and ML components
Implement a simple ML model to classify metrics (optional: use supervised learning if you want to provide training examples)
Create a web interface using Flask or Streamlit
Implement data visualization using Plotly, Matplotlib, or similar libraries
Include documentation explaining your approach and methodology
Evaluation Criteria:
Accuracy in identifying potential vanity metrics
Quality of metric recommendations and justifications
User experience and interface design
Code quality and documentation
Innovation in approach to metric classification
Implementation Approach
Suggested Steps:
Data Exploration & Preprocessing
Load and analyze the CSV data
Clean and preprocess the data as needed
Extract features for classification
Vanity Metric Detection Algorithm
Define criteria for identifying vanity metrics
Implement rules-based or ML-based classification
Test and validate the classification accuracy
Metric Value Assessment
Create a scoring system to evaluate metric importance
Consider factors like frequency of use in decisions, recency, and impact
Rank metrics by department based on value score
Dashboard Development
Design an intuitive interface for displaying results
Create interactive visualizations of metric analysis
Implement filters and sorting capabilities
Documentation & Testing
Document your approach, algorithms, and code
Test with different datasets or scenarios
Provide installation and usage instructions
Additional Considerations
Consider implementing a feature to simulate the impact of removing vanity metrics
Add functionality to periodically re-evaluate metrics based on usage patterns
Include a recommendation engine for new metrics that might be valuable but aren't currently tracked
Consider ethical implications of how metric recommendations might affect employee behavior
Deliverables
Full source code for the KPI audit tool
Documentation including:
Technical approach and methodology
Installation instructions
User guide
A demo video or presentation showing the tool in action
Summary report of findings from analyzing the provided dataset
Remember, the goal is to help organizations focus on metrics that actually drive outcomes rather than those that just look good on a dashboard. Your tool should promote data-driven decision-making by cutting through the noise of vanity metrics.
